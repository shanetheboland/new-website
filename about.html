                    <p>Delight is a software development studio. Our goal is to bring delightful experiences to clients and users.</p>
                    <p>Our team has been working together for many years. In April of 2015, we adopted the name Delight and set up shop officially in Saratoga Springs, New York.</p>
                    <p>We are currently a team of 3 (and one puppy) with plans to grow. We get off on planning delightful user experiences, designing interfaces, and writing code.</p>
