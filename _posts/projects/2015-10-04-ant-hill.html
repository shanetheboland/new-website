                    <p>We were hired to redesign Ant Hill’s website. Ant Hill already had a beta site up and running. But it wasn’t attracting or retaining users. The website was slow and clunky and desperately in need of some tender loving care.</p>
                    <p>It was important that the new website would:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attract and retain users</li>

                    <p>Ant Hill was founded by Marcella Jewell during her time at Skidmore College. Marcella first met Delight in Las Vegas at the 2015 Thiel Summit. Marcella needed a team that could build a web application for Ant Hill. A team that could work in-house and remote.</p>
                    <p>For most of this project, we worked in Ant Hill’s office. They graciously provided us with bagels, coffee, a foosball table, and chairs that don’t hurt your back.</p>

            Second, they arrive on the Dashboard page where they have the option to continue filling out their profile. They also have the option to explore the site at this point and begin posting/applying to jobs.</p>
