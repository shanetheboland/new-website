        <h1>Ant Hill</h1>
        <p>​Ant Hill is a startup from Saratoga, New York. Their goal is to help college students find jobs at local small businesses. We built them a web application that helped them create 154 local jobs for unemployed college students in 3 months.</p>

<h2>Client</h2>
<p>Ant Hill was founded by Marcella Jewell during her time at Skidmore College. Marcella first met Delight in Las Vegas at the 2015 Thiel Summit. Marcella needed a team that could build a web application for Ant Hill. A team that could work in-house and remote.</p>

<h2>Project</h2>
<p>We were hired to redesign Ant Hill’s website. Ant Hill already had a beta site up and running. But it wasn’t attracting or retaining users. The website was slow and clunky and desperately in need of some tender loving care. It was important that the new website would:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Attract and retain users</li>
    <li>Work well on devices of all sizes</li>
    <li>Support Ant Hill’s unique two-sided marketplace</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2><!-- entire background is yellow -->

<h3>Onboarding</h3>
<p>Improving the onboarding process was a big focus of ours during the redesign. First, we ask users to sign up using LinkedIn, Facebook, or their email address. Second, they arrive on the Dashboard page where they have the option to continue filling out their profile. They also have the option to explore the site at this point and begin posting/applying to jobs.</p>

<h3>Post a Job</h3>
<p>Once a business owner has signed on to the site, we want them to post a job. It was important that the Job Posting process was simple and painless. We ask the user a few quick questions, they click Post Job, and their job is posted. After this, they sit and wait for the applications to roll in.</p>

<h3>Find a Job</h3>
<p>For students, finding a job is just as easy as posting a job. Users can scroll through a list of jobs in their area and use Advanced Search to narrow down the list. Once they find a job they’re interested in, they just click “Apply”. Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy.</p>

<p>Students can also search for a job using the Map View. The map uses Google Maps API and places pins on jobs near the user’s location.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>We had a ton of fun working with the Ant Hill team. After 3 months of working together, we created 154 jobs, created a great platform that students and businesses are using more and more everyday.</p>
