            <p>Ecovative is a biomaterials company from Green Island, New York. They grow environmentally-friendly products using mushrooms. Yes, mushrooms.</p>
            <p>We were hired to redesign Ecovative’s website. It was important that the new site had solid content and clear navigation.</p>

                    <p>Ecovative hired us to redesign their old website. The old website had confusing content and navigation. It was also difficult for Ecovative to make quick changes to the site. They needed a company that would listen to their needs, design a professional looking website, and maintain the website after it was finished.</p>
                    <p>It was important that the new website had:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A clear navigation and information structure</li>
                        <li>A fresh design with better typography</li>
                        <li>An admin panel where they could manage the website</li>

        “We hired Delight Consulting for the redesign of our website, ecovativedesign.com, in June 2015. Our previous web design did not allow for us to easily make changes or edits to the page, and this was a must have for our ever growing and changing company. Hunter and Shane worked diligently with our team to develop a new, more professional style for our website. They made smart design and content suggestions, recommended photographers, transferred content, and really delivered on any request we had. They also created an easy to use admin panel for the site that allows us to easily post blogs and job availabilities, and even archive and export our media appearances- saving us from having to buy expensive software from another company. Hunter and Shane listened to our needs as a company and delivered an easy to use and professional site that we are thrilled with.”
